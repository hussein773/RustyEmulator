# Rusty Simulator (Work in Progress)

Welcome to **Rusty Simulator**, a digital circuit simulator written in Rust! This project allows you to design, simulate, and test logic circuits with ease, making it an excellent tool for students, 
hobbyists, and anyone interested in learning about digital circuits..

## Features (Implemented)

- **Support for essential components such as**:
  - Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
  - LEDs
  - Sources (input signals)
- **Interactive circuit design** with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Modular structure**, allowing for future expandability.

## Roadmap

- Implementation of a **wiring function** to connect components.
- Expansion of the **component library** with additional logic gates and devices.
- Support for **exporting circuits in Verilog format**.
- Ability to define **custom components via JSON**.

**Rusty Simulator** is a fun little project that makes playing with digital circuits easy and interactive. Itâ€™s still a work in progress, 
but the goal is to make it as intuitive and powerful as possible. 
Whether you're here to learn, tinker, or just mess around with logic gates, feel free to jump in, break things, and maybe even help improve it along the way. Stay tuned for updates, and happy simulating!
